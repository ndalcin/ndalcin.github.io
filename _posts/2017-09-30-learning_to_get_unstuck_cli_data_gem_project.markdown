So, I am just over a month into the FSWD program and I just (at least, I think?) finished my CLI Data Gem Project! I am definitely feeling pretty proud of myself right about now! I have a functioning CLI that actually shows me information that I want to see! 

For my project, I chose to create an application that shows the user a list of flight deals of the day from a website that I frequently use, AirfareWatchDog! I was excited to make an application that I would actually want to use, so this website was perfect for the project! So, I had figured out what I wanted my project to be about but... where and how did I begin?

The beginning was definitely the hardest part. I am still really new to gems and bundlers, so I struggled a lot at the start. I felt really frustrated because I knew that setting up the applications files wasn't even the main part of the project, yet I was spending a lot of time trying to figure it out. I watched Avi's video demos and utilized them as 'code-alongs' while I attempted to get the right folders and files set up. I started over two times before deciding to just create an application from scratch (without using bundler) and I just ended up writing my own files. Once I had the right structure, I began working on my lib files!

Even though I felt accomplished having set up the project files, I knew that I had a long way to go. For the first time, I had NO instruction whatsoever for how to create modules, classes, methods, etc. I spent a lot of time looking at old labs for guidance. I panicked a few times when I realized that I couldn't use the Ask A Question feature to get help with this project. There were times that I thought to myself,
### **"What am I doing? I am not ready for this. Why did Flatiron think that I was ready to create something ON MY OWN?!"** 

Even though I had this thought pretty often, I kept pushing. Everytime I didn't know what to do next, I talked about it outloud. I would go over the process in simple terms and then think about how to apply that to my code. I did this every step of the way. 

At one point, while scraping information off of the website, I thought that for sure, I was stuck and there was no way. The HTML the individual flight deal page was set up in a way that made it difficult to scrape the extra details that I wanted to provide the user with. Each detail was set up as a list item with the same class, however, each flight deal had a different amount of details provided, sometimes with overlap, sometimes without. Luckily, Corinna came to the rescue and helped me out with this! We talked about how the hardest part of programming is knowing what to ask. Sometimes we are stuck and we don't realize how to get 'unstuck' because we don't even know what to ask about.

While I feel really excited to have finished this first project, I know that I still have a loooongggg way to go. I am okay with the fact that I might always experience the feeling of being stuck, but I have learned a few things to do when that feeling strikes:
1. DON'T PANIC. Take a deep breath and calmy say or write down what the problem is
2. Explain to yourself what you DO know. Give yourself some credit for the things you can do. Tell yourself that what you don't know is not far out of your reach.
3. Ask for help! There is nothing wrong with needing help, especially right now when you are still at the beginning.
4. GOOGLE IT! 


After I finish up this blog post, I will be submitting my CLI project for review! Fingers crossed that I pass! If you are interested, feel free to hop over to my Github page and check out my airfarewatchdog-cli-app repo! Who knows, you might even use it to plan your next vacation!
