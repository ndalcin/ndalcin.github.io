Well, this has certainly been an interesting week!!  When I arrived at my Rails Project Lesson last weekend, I felt in no way ready to undertake, what felt like, the impossible task of building my very own Rails application. Today, however, I feel very proud and excited to say that I am just about finished with it! 

*Sigh of relief  (... well, almost)

I am still having some (sort of major) issues with my git repo, after accidentally having added my 30 minute coding session file to one of the commits, so I am frantically working on a solution for that! But, as far as my Rails Travel App goes, everything seems to be working the way I wanted it to !!!

Travel On Rails, is a very basic travel planning application. Anyone can browse the destinations we go to and the activities offered at each destination. Users can sign up or sign in through GitHub. As a user, you can create Vacations, selecting from the predetermined destinations and activities. Every vacation as a budget, which is tracked and modified after selecting the activities you want to do. I had much bigger ideas when I first started this project, but I realized that before I could 'think big', I had to code a bit 'smaller'. I know that one day, I will be able to implement more of the ideas I had at the beginning, but for today, I am excited with the application I have made!

Even though I really struggled a lot with this project, I feel like I have a much better understanding of some of the concepts in Rails that I had found confusing at the beginning. I feel way more confident creating nested forms and using the various form helpers now. Don't get me wrong- I totally spent hours feeling confused and frustrated about why it wasn't doing what I wanted it to do and about how difficult it was to find good resources (SOThankfulForStackOverflow), but all of the frustration was worth it in the end. If I had to completely start this project over again (which I very well may have to if I accidentally delete all of my code trying to fix my broken commit), I am confident that it would be much easier the second time around.

While the Rails section has taken me longer than anticipated, I know that this is just all part of the process. Struggling, learning to debug, problem-solving, followed by more struggling seems to be the norm as a begginer developer. I am much better at finding solutions than I was one more ago, so I know that I am improving. There's nothing better than the feeling you get when something works after hours of frustration! I have a long way to go before these concepts come 'easily' to me, but I know that I won't give up!
