Here we are again, this time after completing project #4! It's hard to believe that after this, I only have one project remaining in the FSWD program. This project, like the Rails project, certainly had its challenges. I know that I made more work for myself because of my complicated associations/relationships in my Rails API (project #3), so I should have known that I would be presented with (even bigger) challenges when expanding the application with jQuery and JS.

Things that I learned:

1. These two projects would have been MUCH easier if I had structured my project more closely to the suggested projects in the curriculum. I thought that I could show off my skills by scaling up a bit on the suggested structure by adding more models and making my associations more complex, but boy was this a mistake! I found it really hard to implement the features required of the projects given the more complex structure of my application.
2. Scaling back is NOT easy! When I started to add the dynamic features with jQuery, I panicked because I couldn't get things to work. I was convinced that the complexity of my original project was the culprit of my inability to add new features, so I took about 20 steps backwards and restructured a lot of my API. Hindsight is 20-20, right? Looking back, I know I made even more work for myself as a result of this. If I had just kept pushing, I am confident now that I would have figured things out, without changing so much. That being said, I know that I learned a ton of new things by struggling!
3. I REALLY hated CSS before this project, but now, I only *just* hate it. I wouldn't quite say that it's 'growing on me', but I do feel a bit more comfortable? I spent a lot of time trying to understand Bootstrap and I can say that I am, at the very least, capable of structuring <div>s ? I even added a background image!
4. JS functions can be insanely complex. I am realizing that you can do just about anything if you can follow the functions. It is a bit like 'Inception' with functions inside functions inside functions. At the beginning, this was really intimidating and impossible for me to comprehend, but with each function, I am getting more and more confident. 
5. I know what I am doing. Well, kind of. But the most important thing I learned through this project is that I **do** have the skills to program. Most recently, I am impressed with my Googling skills. This project was hard and frustrating from start to finish, but there was not a single day where I felt that I wouldn't be able to figure it out. I'm not saying that I was always calm and collected, but I truly felt that I **could** do whatever I set my mind to. 

It has been a long week working on this project, so, I am going to give myself a well-deserved break and enjoy this unusually warm winter day! 

Until next time!
