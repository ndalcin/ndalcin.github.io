Well, here I am two months in to Flatiron's FSWD Program and I am in the beginning stages of understanding how to 'build a house'. Somewhere in one of the labs, they used the analogy that we have to learn what tools we need and how to use those tools before we can build the house. After many long days struggling with methods, arrays, hashes, migrations, and routes, it has been really exciting to put all of those things together in the Sinatra Project!

For my project, I decided to go with the travel theme again (my CLI gem project was airfare flight deals) and make a travel planning application. The idea is that the user can add trips to their account with a form, filling in information like budget, number of travelers, and the departure city of their flight (if needed). The user can edit their own trips as well as view other trips for ideas. This Sinatra application is just the start of the 'bigger picture' idea I had, which was that a user would give their information and someone from the site would come back to them with a planned trip that meets the guidelines of their budget, but DEFINITELY not ready for that next step (yet!)

This project probably shouldn't have taken me this long to complete, but I kept changing the structures around. I wanted to try to make it more complex, but I just ended up going down a rabbit hole, only to rollback my migrations and revert back to my original idea. I wanted to prove to myself that I could take it 'to the next level', but I think that maybe I'll wait for the next project to do that!

I am having so much fun learning to code and this project has made me feel really excited about a future career in programming! I couldn't be more certain that enrolling in Flatiron's Full Stack Web Development program two months ago was the right move for me :)
