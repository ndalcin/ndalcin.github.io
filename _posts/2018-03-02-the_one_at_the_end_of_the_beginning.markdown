As I approach the end of Flatiron's FSWD Online Bootcamp, I find myself reflecting back on these past 6 months.

On August 21, 2017, I made my first monthly payment to Flatiron and officially began my journey through the curriculum. On August 21st, I also started working at my part-time job at a cancer nonprofit as an Administrative Assistant. When I woke up that morning, I knew that August 21 would be the start of a really exciting, but difficult chapter in my life. I had no idea what working part time and studying full time would entail, but I set off with a goal in mind- I wanted to graduate from Flatiron in 6 months. I decided on a schedule and set off on the journey.

A typical week for me looked like this:

**Monday-Friday:**

6-6:30am:      Wake up, listen to podcast, COFFEE
6:30am - 1:00pm:         Learn.co on my exercise ball.
1-1:45pm:      Eat lunch and get ready for work
2-6pm:      Work. Sneak on to Slack/Learn.co
6:30-7:30pm:       Gym
7:45-8:30pm:       Shower and eat dinner, maybe watch a episode of TV while eating
8:30-10/10:30pm:        Learn.co
		 SLEEEEEPPPP
		 
**Saturday&Sunday**
6:30am:     Wake up, COFFEE
7:00am - 10pm :     Learn.co .... take some breaks to eat 
(At some point during the weekend, I go to the gym and run errands, but for the most part, I am coding)

*WARNING: I do not recommend this work/school/life balance* 

Juggling school and work was not easy. My first month, I was obsessive about my progress with Flatiron and determined to work as many hours as I could to have some money coming in. I gave up doing everything I enjoyed and any time that I didn't spend at work or sleeping, I was coding. There were weekend days that I didn't get out of my pajamas until 5pm when I would force myself to put gym clothes on, go to the gym for an hour, to come home and code until I went to sleep. I wasn't miserable doing this because, since the very beginning, I have LOVED learning to code, but I could feel myself burning out. That first month, I didn't see my friends, I didn't watch any Netflix, and I didn't give myself a break. The day I realized that I hadn't been for a walk (something I did **every** day before Flatiron) in a month, I knew something had to change. 

From month two, I started forcing myself to take walks on sunny days and take the occasional night off from coding to watch a TV show. If plans or an event came up, I would give myself a day off to see my friends. I realized how important it was to maintain a more balanced schedule. I still mostly followed the above schedule, but I definitely allowed myself a bit more flexibility. I also realized that it was more important that I took extra time, as needed, to understand the material, instead of rushing through it just to mark the lesson 'completed'. Once I slowed down, I felt like I was on a much better path. I stopped trying to rush to the end and instead, I started focusing on one section at a time. This lead me to start living more in the present moment and focusing on one day at a time. It may sound cliche, but my journey throughout the last six months has truly resulted in immense personal growth.

Well, the date is March 2nd and as of the submission of this blog post, I will have met all of the requirements to graduate from Flatiron. *Technically* I am just over one week past my goal end date, but hey, life happens. I am incredibly proud of myself for making it through to the end, but I know that this is just the beginning of my journey with web development. I have learned so much during my time enrolled in Flatiron. I have learned how to debug efficiently, how/when to ask for help, and most importantly, how to code! I know that this is just the beginning of my journey with web development, but I am excited for what the future holds. I am looking forward continuing to learn for a very, *very* long time! But maybe for the next few days I can give myself a bit of a rest... at least sleep in past 6:30am :D

	if (submitFinalBlogPost && passReactProject) {
				  this.setState({ 
							   graduate: true,
								 jobSearch: true
	         })
	}
	
	...on to the next phase!
