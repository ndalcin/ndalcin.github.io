I have always hated this question. So, I did what I needed to do to avoid answering it. I have not had the most 'conventional' post-college experience. Right after I graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in Biology, I decided to use all of the desired knowledge and skills gained through my studies and ... teach... no, not Biology... English... in Asia. 

**Person:** "But, wait. You weren't an English major? How do you teach English? Can you speak Korean? Can you speak Japanese? I don't understand. How do you teach them if you can't speak their language?"

**Me:** "I don't really know. You just kind of.. figure it out? Trial and error, I guess"

**Person:** "Wow! That must be so hard! But that's so cool!"

These are the types of conversations that I was used to having for over three years. It **was** hard and it **was** cool. Every day was a challenge and I loved every minute of it. I had an incredible experience living and working in two different Asian megacities. I made friends from all over the world. I saw countries that most people will never see in their lifetime. I ate incredible foods and sang karaoke until I had no voice. But, there was always something missing.

When I moved back to the US in May of 2017, I knew that I was finally ready to face reality and attempt to figure out the answer to the question I dreaded most. While I enjoyed teaching, I have always loved to learn. While I enjoyed working a mindless job, I have always loved to be challenged mentally. While I enjoyed my carefree lifestyle, I knew I was ready for the next step. I knew that I was finally ready to figure out what job or skill would excite me on a daily basis. 

While my background in programming is close to nonexistent, I have always been interested in technology. I was the only one of my friends who, at ten years old, was responsible for contacting Comcast biweekly when the internet wasn't working. I am the person my friends come to when they are having a problem with their phone, computer, or tablet. I am someone who is crazy enough to buy the mini-screwdrivers necessary to open up my Macbook Pro in order to replace the hard drive, battery, and other parts when they arenâ€™t working as they should. I like diagnosing a problem and solving it myself, even if it means Googling the step-by-step directions. So, when a friend of mine who works at a tech startup forwarded me an email about an intensive bootcamp at The Flatiron School, I thought, "This is exactly what I have been looking for."

I am learning to code because I am excited to learn again. I am learning to code because I want to feel challenged and frustrated, just to experience the feeling of a breakthrough. I am learning to code because I love solving problems in the most efficient and effective way possible. I am learning to code because I am already excited for the day when I can confidently answer my least favorite question with:

# "I work as a Full Stack Web Developer."
